    bio:
      'Ann Druyan is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning writer and producer who has dedicated her life to science. In 1980, Ann, alongside late husband Carl Sagan, wrote the 1980 original COSMOS: A Personal Voyage â€” which was a 13-part television event on PBS. COSMOS is still one of the most-watched programs in the history of PBS and its airing was a major moment for science-themed television.',
